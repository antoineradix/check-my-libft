# Getting Started
Welcome to check-my-libft, a libft tester I developed in 2023 for testing my own libft.<br>
While you can use this tester as is, it's highly recommended to fork this repository and add your own tests as you develop your libft.

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone git@github.com:antoineradix/check-my-libft.git
```

## Configuration
In the Makfile, edit the `LIBFT_PATH` variable to define the path to your libft folder.<br>

## Usage
To compile and test your libft with check-my-libft, you can run:
- `make`: test all functions
- `make part1`: test part1 functions
- `make part2`: test part2 functions
- `make bonus`: test bonus functions
- `make ft_function`: test a single function
